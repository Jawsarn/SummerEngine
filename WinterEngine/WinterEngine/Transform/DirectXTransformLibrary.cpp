//TODO:: Transform compnoent, not sure where I want the info, but I want it to be XMFLOAT4X4 if we're using windows, which puts me to the mood that we want some sort of interface to it, where
//the graphic and physics(?) engine can work around to get the directx values directly. This because the directX values can compute on the graphics drive in a nice way, and we can upload matrixes to
//graphic card diretly for drawing.
